# Reksio-noCD-Patches
 Xdelta patches for removing copy protection from the Reksio games

 Confirmed compatibility only with the Romanian versions; Polish patches already exist elsewhere

 Can be applied with any Xdelta utility, such as [this one](https://kotcrab.github.io/xdelta-wasm/), simply input the relevant game's executable and its corresponding patch then place the output back in the game directory

 IMPORTANT: For Reksio și Căpitanul Nemo, to run the game without a disc it is also required to copy the directory \dane\game\przygoda\cutscenki\32B_DO_AMERYKI from the disc to the installation directory. Otherwise, since the installer does not copy it automatically, the game will crash just before the the America chapter if a disc is not inserted.
 
 Installing this mod represents a modification of the game files in violation of the end-user licence agreement
